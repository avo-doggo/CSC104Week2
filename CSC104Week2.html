        How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, <br> <!--break, go to next line-->
    or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?<br>
    His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. <br>
    Beautiful!<br>
    Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath;<br>
    his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; <br>
    his teeth of a pearly whiteness;<br>
     but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,<br>
      that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set,<br>
       his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.
